## Project overview

This is a project I did to experiment with the Vue.JS framework. It pulls in data from both RSS feeds and API's.

## Features

- VUE3, especially the <Suspense> tag.
- Bootstrap (via CDN, as BootstrapVue does not yet play nice with Vue3)
- Font Awesome

Note that layout is not my strong suit, but I did incorporate some fun features, like a scrollable card deck for the hourly forecast.
